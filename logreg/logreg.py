"""
    Maximum likelihood estimation from https://github.com/bond005/python-logreg
    minst dataset with log Likelihood_function.

    The logreg.py module was created for educational purposes for practical lessons on 
    the course "Methods and algorithms of computer linguistics", read to students of 
    the Faculty of Humanities at Novosibirsk State University.

    In the logreg.py module, a logistic regression algorithm is implemented to solve 
    the classification problem. The process of learning logistic regression is considered 
    as maximization of the logarithm of the likelihood function by the gradient method.

    The logreg.py module is developed in the Python 3.x/2.x programming language using the 
    NumPy Python library. The module can be used as a component of any Python-program, 
    in which it is necessary to solve the problem of classification using the algorithm 
    of logistic regression. In addition, this module can also be launched as a standalone 
    program: in this case, the learning process for recognizing handwritten digits from the 
    training subsample of the MNIST case will be demonstrated, and then - the process of 
    recognizing the handwritten digits from the MNIST test sub-sample. 

    To run the logreg.py module as a stand-alone program, you must install the Python-library 
    ScikitLearn in the system (the tools of this library allow access to MNIST).

    : Return A tuple of two elements: a learning set and a test set. Each of the sets - both teaching and
    Test - is also specified as a two-element tuple, the first element of which is a set of vectors
    Attributes of input objects (two-dimensional numpy.ndarray-array, the number of rows in which is equal to the number of input objects, and
    The number of columns is equal to the number of features of the object), and the second element is the set of desired output signals for
    Each of the corresponding input objects (one-dimensional numpt.ndarray-array, the number of elements in which is equal to the number
    Input objects).
