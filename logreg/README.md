The logreg.py module was created for educational purposes for practical lessons on the course "Methods and algorithms of computer linguistics", read to students of the Faculty of Humanities at Novosibirsk State University.

In the logreg.py module, a logistic regression algorithm is implemented to solve the classification problem. The process of learning logistic regression is considered as maximization of the logarithm of the likelihood function by the gradient method.

The logreg.py module is developed in the Python 3.x programming language using the NumPy Python library. The module can be used as a component of any Python-program, in which it is necessary to solve the problem of classification using the algorithm of logistic regression. In addition, this module can also be launched as a standalone program: in this case, the learning process for recognizing handwritten digits from the training subsample of the MNIST case will be demonstrated, and then - the process of recognizing the handwritten digits from the MNIST test sub-sample. To run the logreg.py module as a stand-alone program, you must install the Python-library ScikitLearn in the system (the tools of this library allow access to MNIST).
